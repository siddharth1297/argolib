You should not change anything inside these benchmarks for carrying out the experiments.

To summarize, these are the experiments you have to perform:
(1) Argolib (Deadline-1, Part-1): Four benchmarks.
(2) Any TWO optimzations from Deadline-1-Part-2 OR Deadline-2 OR Deadline-3. 
    If its Deadline-1-Part-2 then Fib and QuickSort benchmarks.
    If its Deadline-2 then iterative averaging if you implemented trace/replay, or quicksort if you implemented Hierarchical Work-Stealing (HWS).
    If its Deadline-3 then QuickSort benchmark.

You should report the execution time as an average of five invocations in each experiment. 

What are the experiments that you have to report based on the optimizations you choose:

(a) Speedup over the sequential execution of each benchmark for worker count 20 only.
(b) Total tasks created and total tasks stolen.

Building benchmarks:
---------------------

Sequential version of all four benchmarks are inside the directory "sequential", and the parallel versions inside the directory "parallel".
Both these directories contain Makefile. You won't require any changes in sequential/Makefile, but you would have to set the variables
ARGOLIB_CXXFLAGS, ARGOLIB_LDFLAGS, and ARGOLIB_LDLIBS inside parallel/Makefile. Feel free to update the parallel/Makefile to suite your 
runtime implementation. However, you must use -O3 switch.
